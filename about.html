            <p>I was born in the parish of Kingston, Jamaica. I was the 9th of 16 siblings. I grew up in a small community called Cassava Piece where I was a young role model to others. At the age of 12, I formed a youth organization for the younger children of the community. People young and old were motivated by my work ethic. I would feed the kids in the community, give them shelter if they needed a place to stay and also speak with them if they needed someone to talk to.
                I am a Pastor, entrepreneur and CEO of a nonprofit organization, a wife, and a mother of 3 children and an adopted child, while being a humanitarian and philanthropist.  I am always calm under pressure and could handle anything that was thrown at me. I am greatly respected in my community mainly because of my willing heart and wanting to share not only my time, but sharing the Word of God.
